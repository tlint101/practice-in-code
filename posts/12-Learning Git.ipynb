    "Since my last post, I have hit a lot of personal milestones. I've become a little more comfortable with coding. As someone who is self-taught, it feels like a huge accomplishment to be able to say that. However, there is always more to learn, to improve, and skills to develop. One of the most important ones is [Version Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control).\n",
    "\n",
    "For those in academia, GitHub is the repository host of choice. Though, I think Codeberg is a good one too and I have begun mirroring many of my projects. Hopefully I can wean myself from Github in the future, since the projects on GitHub is used to train Microsoft's Copilot, and [potentially exposing private GitHub repositories](https://www.developer-tech.com/news/microsoft-copilot-continues-to-expose-private-github-repositories/). Codeberg, as far as I know, cannot be used to train LLMs.\n",

    "### How I Started Using Git\n",
    "As my projects have become bigger and ambitious, it has become vital to record and track the changes to my code. This is a natural progression for any developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started writing my projects in Jupyter Notebooks. I love the ability to write in distinct code blocks and to immediately get results printed on script. It helps that each code block can be run out of order, which allows testing and learning of code or custom API. Importantly, with the mix of code and markdown blocks, Jupyter Notebooks are great ways to communicate, share, and teach others your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "My original interaction with Jupyter Notebooks was through the traditional portal - the localhost connection. It was simple and easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I got comfortable with simple command scripts, I began making more complicated functions, which requires better organization skills. On the advice of a friend, I began using [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDE)s. There are plenty out there, like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org). But I gravitated toward the [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/?var=1) software suite - particularly [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).\n",
    "\n",
    "I like the JetBrains software because of the look of the interface and the ability to customize how it looks. I am an insane person and will change my IDE theme each day depending on my mood. Everyone is different, so play around with each one and find one that you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "A main advantage with PyCharm is its integration with Git. It is there from the get go and ready for set up. Plugin with your GitHub account and users are ready to commit, push, or pull their projects. The GUI made it easy peasy! My workflow became:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create repository on GitHub\n",
    "- Clone repository through PyCharm onto my machine\n",
    "- Code\n",
    "- Commit/Push/Pull as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "It was simple and I got comfortable with that for a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, PyCharm is mainly \"connected\" to GitHub. As I begin to transition/mirror projects to Codeberg, I found that the GUI becomes unfriendly and clunky. That has caused me to learn a few command line codes that I found useful."

    "### Git Commands I Use\n",

If things break, I hope I can figure things out in the future!"
